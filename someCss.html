        <h2>Festival Idea</h2>
        <p>Our festival will be focused around the Yoga Sutras and the Ashtanga or the eight limbs of yoga. There will be eight stages setup in various locations of the festival grounds that represent each limb and where yogis will spend time practicing with a yoga instructor. Once the yogis feel ready they will be welcome to the center of the eight limbs where they will practice yoga on their own with the end goal of reaching pure consciousness. We will also have Mouna where yogis will have times of silence and if they choose can last the entire length of the festival. Starting around 6pm each night we will begin to have music on various stages at the festival but there will still be options for yoga practice though instructors will no longer be available. Explanation of the stages will take place in the slides following.

        <p>Overall, we think this would be a spectacular opportunity for the community of Darrington and surrounding areas as it would bring in customers and tourism after a very long lock down that everyone in the state has had to endure. This would also be extremely helpful for vendors, instructors, and musical artists attending the festival. Yogis from all over would benefit from amazing yoga practice that would help strengthen them mentally and physically while all taking place in the heart of the Mt. Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest.
